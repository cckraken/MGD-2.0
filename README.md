# MGD-2.0
Updated and modernised version of Metal Gear Data. Original version was developed in 2017/8 so a lot of stuff is out of date.

Identified tasks:

Data validation - The previous data validation method is a long string if-else lines with some try-catch clauses in there.
                  It's incredibly long and clunky, even if it works.
                  
                  Replaced with Fluentvalidation package but not yet complete.

Database connectivity - Previous version used local MySQL database. Decided to go with SQL Server 2019 to expand my skillset.
     
                        Added basic SQL Server 2019 database functionality. More work to be done.
                        
CSS was very simple first time around. Still relatively simple now, although improved. More to be done.

JavaScript - None used in previous version. Added message box functionality, will be expanded later.

More to be added -
