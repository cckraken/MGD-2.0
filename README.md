# MGD-2.0
Updated and modernised version of Metal Gear Data. Original version was developed in 2017/8 so a lot of stuff is out of date.

Identified tasks:

Data validation - The previous data validation method is a long string if-else lines with some try-catch clauses in there.
                  It's incredibly long and clunky, even if it works.
                  
                  Replaced with Fluentvalidation package but not yet complete.

Database connectivity - Previous version used local MySQL database. Decided to go with SQL Server 2019 to expand my skillset.
     
                        Not yet complete
                        
More to be added -
